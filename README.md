## Signalized Intersections | Toronto
---

This is a map of all the signalized
intersections in Toronto (i.e. traffic lights)
and the year they were first installed. The
earliest traffic light in the city was at
Yonge and Bloor in 1925. The points also
have counts of vehicle and pedestrian
volumes over an 8 hour period. These were
each only recorded for a single day
sometime between 2007 and 2016, so they
should only be taken with a grain of salt!
